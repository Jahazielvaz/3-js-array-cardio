INTRO: The purpose of this project is to help you get really good with array methods. As such, you are recomended to follow the tutorial closely, and then to go try each of these methods multiple times in the console until you have good dominion over them.

REQUIREMENTS:
Master the following array methods, to the point where you can perform each of them without having to look up the syntax, and that you fully understand how each of them work, and why they work. You also need to get to a level where you no longer forget them when you're not using them.
-filter() : This allows you to select certain records in a table and return them based on the criteria you give them.
-map() : This allows you to iterate through an array and apply the desired function to each object in the array, and returns a brand new array with the desired outcome. This could be great if you want to return certain values from each of the objects in the array.
-sort() : This allows you to edit your table and organize it based on the criteria you give it.
-reduce() : This allows you to iterate through every value inside the array, and then pass in a function. Pretty similar to the map feature, but it does have one big distinction. The map feature always accounts for every single value in the array, and returns each of the values with the new desired outcome, while the reduce feature return the sum of all the values into one single attribute

THINGS I'VE LEARNED
-Console.table() is super cool. It actually shows you the data in an itemized table. Super cool!
-You can't use return statement on the ternary operators


THINGS TO PRACTICE
-When there is a boolean, practice just assigning the conditions required to be true to the desired datatype, as opposed to having to actually write an if else statement.
  EXAMPLE:
    Go from this:
      if(variable == "random sentence"){
        return true
      }

    to this:
      (variable == "random sentence")
