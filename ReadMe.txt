INTRO: The purpose of this project is to help you get really good with array methods. As such, you are recomended to follow the tutorial closely, and then to go try each of these methods multiple times in the console until you have good dominion over them.

REQUIREMENTS:
Master the following array methods, to the point where you can perform each of them without having to look up the syntax, and that you fully understand how each of them work, and why they work. You also need to get to a level where you no longer forget them when you're not using them.
-filter() :
-map() :
-sort() :
-reduce() :

THINGS I'VE LEARNED
-Console.table() is super cool. It actually shows you the data in an itemized table. Super cool!


THINGS TO PRACTICE
-When there is a boolean, practice just assigning the conditions required to be true to the desired datatype, as opposed to having to actually write an if else statement.
  EXAMPLE:
    Go from this:
      if(variable == "random sentence"){
        return true
      }

    to this:
      (variable == "random sentence")
